                    <h2>Haden Macdonald</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hi! My name is Haden, with no “y.” My last name is Macdonald, spelled “M A C,” and with a
                        lowercase “d.” I was born in
                        Encinitas, California almost 19 years ago. I have two younger sisters, one of whom is in high school
                        and one of whom is in elementary
                        school. As a child, I enjoyed playing with Hot Wheels, riding my bike, and striking out in Little
                        League. I started playing the piano when
                        I was eight years old and haven’t stopped since. In high school I joined the cross country and track
                        teams. I made it onto varsity and ended
                        my final track season with a mile time of 4:42.

                        When I began the process of applying to college, I didn’t really have any idea what I was doing. I
                        just followed what
                        everyone else did and applied to the state schools, a couple of reaches, and some colleges that
                        ranked highly for
                        political science. And yet, there was no single college that I was excited to go to. Of all the
                        schools I toured,
                        none really stood out to me. Even if I liked the campus, I would convince myself that there was some
                        other reason I shouldn’t
                        go there. I have so many regrets about how I thought about this process and my ultimate decision
                        weighs on me every day.
                        I feel like I missed out on so many great experiences and friends because I chose a college that had
                        a higher ranking
                        rather than choosing a college that I would be happy to go to. That’s how I ended up at Rutgers, the
                        State University of
                        New Jersey. The campus is ugly, overly large, and worst of all, on the East Coast. The dorms were
                        cramped, old, and smelly.
                        An outdated, never-on-time bus system provides the only transportation to get across the sprawling
                        campus. But at least it had
                        a pretty good political science program. I would ask myself over and over again, “What am I doing
                        here?” I felt so lost and
                        directionless. I knew I had to try to make the most of it. I met people, I joined clubs, I went to
                        every class. Then one
                        morning it all fell apart. I couldn’t bear to be at Rutgers anymore. I was bored and miserable. I
                        began the process of
                        transferring.

                        After a long, arduous process, I made it here. I love the campus at University of Oregon. This
                        university outclasses Rutgers
                        in every possible way. I’m definitely a different person than the one I was six months ago. I am
                        very excited to be here and
                        I hope to meet as many new people as I can.
